# Team Photos Guide

## Photo Requirements

To display team member photos on the landing page, add the following image files to this `photos` folder:

### Required Files:
- `rocky.png` - Dr. Rocky Talchabhadel (Principal Investigator)
- `saurav.png` - Saurav Bhattarai (Lead Developer)
- `sunil.png` - Sunil Bista (Documentation Specialist)
- `subash.png` - Subash Poudel (Training Coordinator)
- `samuel.png` - Samuel Terret (Undergraduate Researcher)
- `douglas.png` - Douglas Jones (Undergraduate Researcher)

### Workshop Photos (Optional):
You can also add workshop photos to enhance the gallery section:
- `workshop1.jpeg` - Workshop Photo 1
- `workshop2.jpeg` - Workshop Photo 2  
- `workshop3.jpeg` - Workshop Photo 3

### Photo Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or JPEG
- **Team Photos**: Minimum 200x200 pixels (square aspect ratio recommended)
- **Workshop Photos**: Any aspect ratio, minimum 800x600 pixels for good quality
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display
- **Background**: Any background is fine - team photos will be displayed in circular frames

### How It Works:
1. Place the photo files in this folder with the exact names listed above
2. The website will automatically load and display the photos
3. If a photo file is missing or fails to load, it will show a fallback icon/placeholder
4. Team photos are automatically cropped to circular shape and optimized for web display
5. Workshop photos will replace the placeholder boxes in the gallery section

### Testing:
After adding photos, open the website and check:
- The "Team" section for team member photos
- The "Media & Community Voices" section for workshop photos

### Notes:
- File names are case-sensitive
- Make sure photos are properly oriented before uploading
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB each) for fast loading
- You can use different formats (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) but maintain the base filename
- Workshop photos are optional - placeholders will show if photos aren't available
